# FishFood Game

Welcome to FishFood, an exciting underwater adventure game where you navigate the depths of the ocean as a fish.

## Game Description

In FishFood, you play as a fish striving to survive in a dynamic underwater world. Your goal is to eat smaller fish to gain points and grow in size, while avoiding larger predators.

### Key Features:

- **Dynamic Eating Mechanism**: Eat fish smaller than you to gain points and grow. Collide face-first into another fish to consume it.
- **Size-Based Menu**: A top-left menu indicates which fish you can eat based on your current size.
- **Predators and Power-ups**:
  - Beware of sharks! They can always eat you, except when miniaturized.
  - Seastars grant random power-ups: invincibility or shrinking sharks.
  - Seahorses increase your speed temporarily.
- **Variety of Fish**:
  - Small Red Fish: Worth 1 point, small and bounce off boundaries.
  - Small Green Fish: Worth 2 points, can grow into big green fish.
  - Big Green Fish: Worth 2 points. Predatory if larger than the player.
  - Silver Fish: Worth 3 points, periodically crosses the screen.
  - Rainbow Fish: Changes size and behavior. Predatory when larger than the player.
  - Big Bright Blue Fish: Appears every 50 points and is always predatory.
